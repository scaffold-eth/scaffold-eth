# Blocknative

The [Transactor](../react-app-1/helpers.md#transactor) helper uses Blocknative's Notify to show notifications and keep track of our testnet and mainnet transactions.

You can learn more about Blocknative and Notify here: [https://www.blocknative.com/notify](https://www.blocknative.com/notify)

Make sure to update the `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with [your own Blocknative DappID](https://docs.blocknative.com/notify).
