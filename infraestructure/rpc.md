# RPC

### Infura

Infura is one of the most used node providers for Ethereum. In order for your apps to work, you will need them to connect to an rpc node. Scaffold-eth supports and uses Infura by default.

You will need to update the `constants.js` in `packages/react-app/src` with [your own Infura ID](https://infura.io/).

### Alchemy

Sign up for a free account at [Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/) for you API key.

You will need to update the `constants.js` in `packages/react-app/src` with you new key.

### Moralis

Sign up for a free account at [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) and set up your endpoints.

You will need to update the `constants.js` in `packages/react-app/src` with your new endpoint.
