        The NFT License (this “License”) is built to support applications for
        blockchain technologies, and to help clarify a user’s rights in artistic
        overlays as the owner of a non-fungible token (“NFTs”).
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        Dapper Labs Inc. (“DLI”) created this License as an open-source resource
        for the wider community to encourage adoption of the ERC-721 standard.
        DLI’s goal is to positively shape the future of NFTs for creators of
        blockchain-based art (each, for the purposes of this License, a
        “Creator”) by demystifying the associated user rights while empowering
        Creators to license their work at scale.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        DLI intends to use this License in each of its current and upcoming apps
        (including CryptoKitties®) to help ensure that NFT owners enjoy broad
        and meaningful rights in the art associated with their purchased NFTs.
        DLI encourages other Creators to adopt this License as well.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        When a Creator leverages this License, the Creator should replace the
        word “Creator” with the name of its company or organization and add a
        contact email in section 5. Other than the foregoing modification, DLI
        does not permit other changes to this License. If a Creator wishes to
        make other changes to this License, it may not refer to the resulting
        license as the NFT License, or any variant thereof. Nothing in this
        License gives a Creator or any third party any rights in or to the
        names, marks, or logos of Dapper Labs Inc. (including, without
        limitation, the right to use the “NFT License” mark), or in or to any
        intellectual property rights of DLI, its subsidiaries or affiliates, all
        of which are expressly reserved.

        1. Definitions.
      </Text>
      <Text mb="3">
        “Art” means any art, design, and drawings that may be associated with an
        NFT that you Own.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        &quot;NFT&quot; means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token, such as those
        conforming to the ERC-721 standard.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        “Own” means, with respect to an NFT, an NFT that you have purchased or
        otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of
        such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        “Extensions” means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as
        extensions or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying
        Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the
        underlying Art.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">“Purchased NFT” means an NFT that you Own.</Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without
        limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade
        secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights
        recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.

      <Text mb="3" fontWeight="bold">
        2. Ownership.
      </Text>
      <Text mb="3">
        You acknowledge and agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its
        licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Art,
        and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have
        in and to the Art are limited to those described in this License.
        Creator reserves all rights in and to the Art not expressly granted to
        you in this License.

        3. License.
      </Text>
      <Text mb="3">
        a. General Use. Subject to your continued compliance with the terms of
        this License, Creator grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive,
        non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art
        for your Purchased NFTs, along with any Extensions that you choose to
        create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own
        personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits
        the purchase and sale of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace
        cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art
        for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can
        display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or
        application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of
        your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically
        verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased
        NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and
        provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the
        Purchased NFT leaves the website/application.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3">
        b. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with the terms
        of this License, Creator grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        non-transferable license to use, copy, and display the Art for your
        Purchased NFTs for the purpose of commercializing your own merchandise
        that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs
        (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not result in
        you earning more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in gross
        revenue each year. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section 3.b
        will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a
        marketplace that permits the use and sale of NFTs generally, provided
        that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights
        to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the
        actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party
        website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
        participation of NFTs generally, provided that the third party website
        or application cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to
        display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual
        owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer
        visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the
        website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing,
        even where such revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.

      <Text mb="3" fontWeight="bold">
        4. Restrictions.
      </Text>
      <Text mb="3">
        You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt
        to do any of the foregoing without Creator’s express prior written
        consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased NFT in any
        way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings,
        attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will not constitute
        a prohibited modification hereunder); (ii) use the Art for your
        Purchased NFTs to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or
        service; (iii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in connection with
        images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance,
        violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to
        constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others;
        (iv) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other
        forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly
        permitted in Section 3(b) above or solely for your own personal,
        non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including,
        without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial
        gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains,
        or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs, except as expressly
        permitted in Section 3(b) above; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright,
        or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to
        the Art for your Purchased NFTs; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for
        your Purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To
        the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contains Third
        Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity,
        athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows:
        (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any
        way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and
        restrictions contained herein; (x) that the Commercial Use license in
        Section 3(b) above will not apply; (y) that, depending on the nature of
        the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Creator may
        need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the
        Art; and (z) to the extent that Creator informs you of such additional
        restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible
        for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive
        the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this
        license. The restriction in Section 4 will survive the expiration or
        termination of this License.
      </Text>

      <Text mb="3" fontWeight="bold">
        5. Terms of License.
      </Text>
      <Text mb="3">
        The license granted in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that
        you continue to Own the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you
        sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your
        Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted in Section 3 will
        immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the requirement of
        notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those
        NFTs. If you exceed the $100,000 limitation on annual gross revenue set
        forth in Section 3.b above, you will be in breach of this License, and
        must send an email to Creator at ____________ within fifteen (15) days,
        with the phrase “NFT License - Commercial Use” in the subject line,
        requesting a discussion with Creator regarding entering into a broader
        license agreement or obtaining an exemption (which may be granted or
        withheld in Creator’s sole and absolute discretion). If you exceed the
        scope of the license grant in Section 3.b without entering into a
        broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption from Creator,
        you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in breach of this License;
        (ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Creator at law
        or in equity, the Creator may immediately terminate this License,
        without the requirement of notice; and (iii) you will be responsible to
        reimburse Creator for any costs and expenses incurred by Creator during
        the course of enforcing the terms of this License against you.
